Data imported since Toxo's repository after the execution
of the script 'calculate_all_tables_with_times_max_p.m' with a fix
to setting the Matlab accuracy digits to 64. Model configurations are
explicit in the file titles.

Data generated maximizing the prevalence.

The time files will be appended to 'times.txt' after several 
executions in order to calculate an average and thus obtain a 
better reference.
