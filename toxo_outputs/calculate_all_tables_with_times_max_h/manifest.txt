Data imported since Toxo's repository after the execution
of an adaptation of the script 'calculate_all_tables_with_times_max_h.m'. 
Model configurations are explicit in the file titles.

The adaptation consists in the use of the following parameter
arrays:

- maf = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9]
- p = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9]

So all possible models with the combination of these parameters have
been generated. I.e. a very general sample of all the possible models.

Data generated maximizing the heritability. Using MATLAB default 32 digits.

The file 'errors.txt' contains the Toxo error messages during the execution 
of the full experiment.

The time files will be appended to 'times.txt' after several 
executions in order to calculate an average and thus obtain a 
better reference.
