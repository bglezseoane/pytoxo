        an object with its data.

        The input model must be formatted as a plain CSV, with each line of the
        file corresponding to a row of the model. The rows are made of the
        genotype definition and the probability associated with the given
        genotype, separated by a comma. Probability is expressed as a function
        of two variables, represented as alphabetical characters. Empty lines,
        as well as lines starting with '#' will be ignored.

        Parameters
        ----------
        filename : str
            The path of the text file with the model.

        Raises
        ------
        ModelCSVParsingError
            If the parsing tentative fails due to the file is not well formed.
        IOError
           If the input file is not found or the reading tentative fails due
           to other unexpected operative system level cause.
