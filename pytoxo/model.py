        Uses the model from its text representation in `filename` file and

        The input model must be formatted as a plain CSV, with each line of the
        file corresponding to a row of the model. The rows are made of the
        genotype definition and the probability associated with the given
        genotype, separated by a comma.

        Probability is expressed as a function of two variables, represented
        as alphabetical characters. Only two variables are supported at most.
