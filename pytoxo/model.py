        Uses the model from its text representation in `filename` file and
        inits an object with its data.

        The input model must be formatted as a plain CSV, with each line of the
        file corresponding to a row of the model. The rows are made of the
        genotype definition and the probability associated with the given
        genotype, separated by a comma.

        Probability is expressed as a function of two variables, represented
        as alphabetical characters. Only two variables are supported at most.
        Any pair of alphabetic characters can be used to represent these
        variables, but they must be the same two names for the entire model
        file.

        ----------
